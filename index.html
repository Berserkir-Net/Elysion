<h1>Norman Maclean</h1>

<p>After  teaching in secondary schools for most of my life, I now find myself in the  happy situation where it is possible to pursue other fields, most of which have  been areas of long-term interest.&nbsp;
But nibbling at the edges… giving little time previously to these, has always been  an irritant.</p>
<p>I am interested in now making myself  available in the following spheres, all of which have provided me with plenty  of experience, despite the occasional nature of my involvement up to this point:</p>

<h2> PUBLIC SPEAKING:&nbsp;</h2>
                 
<p>I have wide experience in this  having conducted numerous lectures and seminars here in Gisborne and elsewhere in the North Island. These include:</p>
<p> Guest  speaking at <a href="http://www.rotary.org.nz/site.cfm" target="_new">Rotary</a> dinners;
lectures for the <a href="http://calendar.waikato.ac.nz/archive/2007/academicconsultancy/conted.html" target="_new">Waikato University Continuing Education</a> programme;
talks to <a href="http://u3a.nz/home.htm" target="_new">University of the Third Age</a> and similar groups; 
broadcasting slots for <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national" target="_new">National Radio</a> (Morning Comment and Sunday Supplement  programmes;) addresses to the <a href="http://www.sof.org.nz/" target="_new">Sea of Faith</a> conference and associated organisations.</p>

<p> With  eighteen productions as director for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gisborne-Unity-Theatre-285444834813296/" target="_new">Gisborne Unity Theatre</a> and three for Gisborne Theatre Arts,
plus major shows for <a href="http://www.gisboyshigh.school.nz/" target="_new">Gisborne Boys’ High School</a> where I taught drama over a period of nine years, I am able to offer my services as a director.&nbsp;
I am able to provide with this considerable experience in stage design and costume design: most of the sets for my productions have been designed and painted personally.</p>
<p> I  am prepared to consider employment in these fields for organisations outside of this region, subject to discussion of terms and the signing of an appropriate contract.</p>

<h2> VISUAL  ARTS:</h2>
<p> With  many years practice as Head of Art in both <a href="http://www.gisboyshigh.school.nz/" target="_new">Gisborne Boys’</a> and <a href="http://lyttonhigh.net/" target="_new">Lytton High</a>
 schools, I am able to offer tuition in the fields of drawing, painting 
and  print-making which are all particular interests.&nbsp; I have had 
major exhibitions of paintings and  prints&nbsp; - mostly in zinc-plate 
and solar  plate media – and have works held in collections throughout 
New Zealand and overseas.</p>
                  <p> Illustration  in the form of coloured posters for teachers of Classics are printed by  <a href="http://www.polygraphianz.com/Site/Home.ashx" target="_new">Polygraphia</a>
 in Auckland: I have produced a wide range of these being  commissioned 
to design them for the company many years ago.&nbsp; I have always 
leaned towards imaginative  drawing and in the 1980’s, I had a series of
 cartoons published by the <a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/" target="_new">New  Zealand Listener</a>.&nbsp; Caricatures and  humorous illustration have become major interests.</p>
                  <p> I  was a founder member of the Gisborne Printmakers’ group that began in 1976 and  am currently co-ordinator of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gisborne-Artists-Society-493312327398942/" target="_new">Gisborne Artists’ Society</a> committee.&nbsp; I also run the Life Class for this society:  drawing from the nude model.</p>
                  <p> Associated  with this is a strong fascination with
 art history which I taught for many  years.&nbsp; Particular 
enthusiasms are the  use of iconography and symbolism generally; 
classical Greek and Roman art and  architecture; Christian symbolism; 
the Italian High Renaissance and the moves  to modernism that occurred 
in Europe during the late 19th-early 20th  century.</p>

                  <p> Since  1996 I have been a registered marriage 
celebrant and have conducted over one  hundred ceremonies both locally 
and elsewhere in the country, usually in  outdoor settings selected by 
the couple to be wed.&nbsp; I am able to offer personalized and original
  formats for this, suiting the wording and conduct of the ceremony to 
the wishes  of each couple.</p>
                  <p> Over  the last decade, I have increasingly been 
called upon to also conduct funerals  and have now experienced the whole
 gamut of these from the farewell appropriate  to someone at the end of a
 long life to the much more sensitive handling of  sudden and tragic 
death.</p>
                  <p> Marriages  and funerals are rites of passage which
 mean a great deal to me as I have  become very aware of society’s lack 
of ritual and ceremony.</p>

groups to places of particular  interest in the Mediterranean/ Aegean 
region.&nbsp;  Countries visited include Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Turkey, 
Greece and  Italy.&nbsp; The focus has always been on  classical 
antiquity; on art and architecture; myth, legend and religious belief  
and the cultures of each country.</p>
                  <p> Return  visits to places such as Cairo, Petra, 
Jerusalem, Athens, Rome and Istanbul  would be a pleasure should people 
be interested in finding others to join them  on excursions of three to 
four weeks with full organization of accommodation,  transport and tours

well known but fascinating places made known through archeology,  
religion and the great events of antiquity.</p>

                  <h2>REVELATION:</h2>
                  <p>This  novel by Norman Maclean is available on line or in printed format.&nbsp; It is available from <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/revelation-norman-maclean/1120163294?ean=9781503049963" target="_new">Barnes and Noble</a>, <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/465202" target="_new">Smash  Words</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Norman-Maclean-ebook/dp/B00MSL1PF8" target="_new">Amazon</a> under <a href="http://plaistedpublishing.wix.com/self-publish-service" target="_new">Plaisted Publishing</a> in Rotorua.</p>
                  <p>The  book is historical fiction that takes as its 
focus the writing of the last book  of the New Testament, commonly and 
erroneously accepted as a catalogue of  prophecies for the present age 
when it is actually a coded statement about the  conditions prevailing 
for Christians at the end of the 1st century  C.E.</p>
                  <p>Historians  have long recognized that it alludes to
 the hopes and fears of the early  Christians; cryptically discourses on
 their beliefs and makes numerous  references to the calamitous 
political, social and religious upheavals that  occurred both before and
 after the destruction of the Jewish state by Rome’s  legions in 70 
C.E.&nbsp; This approach has  been adopted by the author also.</p>
                  <p>REVELATION  the novel covers a sweep of time from 
the early years of that century to the  late 90’s when the protagonist, 
one, Kleitos, a Hellenized Jew, is narrating  the story of his 
life.&nbsp; Central to the  theme is a secret that he carries with him 
and cannot reveal until the end:  this revelation throws light on the 
foundational mystery of Christianity – the  apparent resurrection of 
Jesus.</p>
                  <p>Not a book for Christian conservatives, it does,  
however, deal in realities.&nbsp; The reign of  assorted emperors; the 
chaos of the Jewish rebellion against Rome that  culminated in the total
 destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the temple  cult; the 
aggressive, conflicting theological views of early Christian groups  and
 the Neronian persecution, are background to Kleitos’s career that takes
 him  from Caesarea in Judaea to the Greek island of Patmos where he 
finds himself  compelled to care for a bigoted mystic known as John the 
Elder. This man’s  wandering and highly symbolic letter to the seven 
Christian communities of the  Roman east is what became, Revelation, the
 Biblical book.</p>
